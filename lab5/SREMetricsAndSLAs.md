## SRE Metrics & SLAs
---

Key metrics used in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to measure system reliability, availability, and performance can include:
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: specific targets for the level of service a system should provide. Example: response time or error rate
- **Error Budgets**: to measure the acceptable amount of errors or downtime within a given timeframe. It helps balance innovation and reliability
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: to measure the average time between system failures
- **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)**: to measure the average time it takes to recover from a failure, indicating system resilience
- **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**: specific measurements that reflect the performance or behavior of a system. Example: latency or throughput

### Companies:
-  Google
-  Amazon Web Service


### Key metrics used in SRE include:
- **Latency**: time it takes for a system to respond to a user request
- **Availability**: percentage of time a system is operational and accessible to users
- **Request Throughput**: number of requests processed per unit of time
- **Error Rate**: percentage of failed or erroneous requests
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: average time it takes to detect an incident or failure
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: average time it takes to resolve an incident or failure


Google's SLOs for Google Cloud Platform can be found on their website, specifying targets for availability and latency.
AWS provides SLAs for various services, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, guaranteeing uptime and performance levels.


These metrics are crucial for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. SRE teams with the help of these metrics can identify areas for improvement, detect and respond to incidents more efficiently. Moreover, teams can make data-driven decisions to enhance system reliability. Metrics also help in setting realistic expectations for users and stakeholders.
