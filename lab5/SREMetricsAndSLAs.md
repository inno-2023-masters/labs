## Key Metrics for SRE and SLAs

1. SRE relies on several important measurements, including:

   - Uptime: Refers to how long a software system or service remains functional and ready for use, either measured in a specific duration or as a percentage of time. 
   - Response time: It gauges the duration taken for a request to be handled from beginning to end. 
   - Support availability: This indicates whether users can receive prompt and comprehensive support whenever they need it. 
   - Availability: Calculates the percentage of time a system is up and running, allowing users to access it. 
   - Error rate: It evaluates the percentage of requests or transactions that encounter errors or failures.

2. I will consider SLA for Google Cloud Platform and Yandex Cloud Platform.

   - [Yandex cloud](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_sla/): You can find detailed information about SLAs and reliability metrics for various Yandex Cloud services on the SLA agreement page. It provides specific details regarding uptime commitments, performance objectives, and support availability for different GCP products and services. Monthly Uptime Percentage: 99.95%
   - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla): You can find detailed information about SLAs and reliability metrics for various Google Cloud services on the Google Cloud SLA page. It provides specific details regarding uptime commitments, performance objectives, and support availability for different GCP products and services. Monthly Uptime Percentage: 99.95%

3. SRE teams utilize the monitoring and analysis of these crucial metrics to detect opportunities for enhancement, address possible problems in advance, optimize the performance of systems, and consistently improve to guarantee the dependability, accessibility, and efficiency of software systems.
