# Software Reliability Engineering (SRE)

## What is SRE

SOftware Reliability Engineering discipline focuses on ensuring the reliability and dependability of software systems throughout their lifecycle. It involves applying engineering principles and practices to design, build, and maintain software that meets high standards of reliability, availability, and performance..
The goal of SRE is to minimize the occurene and impact of software failures by proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. It involves
requirement engineering, design architecture, design and architecture, testing and validation, monitoring and maintenance, incident management & root cause analyis, continuous improvement.

## Key Metrics for SRE and SLAs

Several key metrics are used to measure system reliability, availability, and performance. Some important metrics commonly used are:

1. Service Level Objective (SLO): SLO is a key performance indicator that defines the desired level of service availability and reliability. It specifies the acceptable level of downtime or error rate within a given time period.

2. Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance: SLA is a contractual agreement between a service provider and its customers, defining the expected service level. SLA compliance measures how well the service provider meets the agreed-upon SLA targets, such as uptime, response time, or error rates.

3. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): MTTD measures the average time it takes to detect an incident or failure within the system. It helps in understanding the efficiency of monitoring and alerting systems.

4. Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): MTTR measures the average time it takes to resolve an incident or failure once it has been detected. It helps in evaluating the efficiency of the incident response and resolution process.

5. Error Budget: Error budget is a concept that defines the allowable amount of errors or downtime within a specific time frame. It helps strike a balance between system reliability and the ability to release new features or updates. Monitoring error budget consumption helps in managing risk and prioritizing improvements.

6. Availability: Availability measures the percentage of time a system or service is operational and accessible to users. It is usually expressed as a percentage, such as 99.9% uptime.

7. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): MTBF measures the average time between two consecutive failures of a system. It provides insights into the overall reliability and stability of the system.

8. Mean Time to Failure (MTTF): MTTF measures the average time until a component or system is expected to fail. It helps in understanding the reliability of individual components.

These metrics help SRE teams monitor and assess the reliability, availability, and performance of systems, identify areas for improvement, and drive continuous improvement efforts. The specific metrics used may vary depending on the nature of the system and the organization's goals and priorities.

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or publicly available reliability metrics used in top Companies

### Microsoft Azure

Some SLAs provided by Azure cloud services

1. Virtual Machines (VMs): Azure offers an SLA for Virtual Machines, guaranteeing at least 99.9% uptime for VMs deployed in a single availability set.
2. App Service: Azure App Service has an SLA of 99.95% for the Web, Mobile, and API apps running in the Standard, Premium, and Isolated tiers.
3. Azure Functions: Azure Functions have an SLA of 99.95% for the consumption plan, which is the serverless compute offering.

### Heroku

Some SLAs provided by Azure cloud services

1. Application Availability: Heroku guarantees 99.5% uptime for applications deployed on its platform.
2. Postgres: Heroku offers a 99.99% uptime SLA for the Heroku Postgres database service.
3. Redis: Heroku provides a 99.9% uptime SLA for the Heroku Redis service.
4. Private Spaces: For applications deployed within Private Spaces, Heroku offers a 99.95% uptime SLA.

## Importance of metrics and how they contribute to reliability and performance of software systems

1. Customer Satisfaction : By ensuring availability of softwares, customers are satisfied of the applications or cloud servies they used as there is little or no down time.
2. Problem Identification and Resolution: SLAs and reliability metrics serve as early warning indicators for potential issues or system failures.
3. Infrastructure Improvement: Regularly monitoring and analyzing SLAs and reliability metrics enable organizations to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
4. Performance Monitoring: SLAs and reliability metrics help monitor the performance of software systems and identify areas of improvement. By tracking metrics like uptime, response time, and error rates, organizations can assess the health of their systems, identify bottlenecks, and take necessary actions to optimize performance.
