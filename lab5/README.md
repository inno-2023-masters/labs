# GitOps & SRE Lab

In this lab, you will explore the principles of GitOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). You will delve into key metrics for SRE and understand how they contribute to the reliability and performance of software systems. Additionally, you will gain hands-on experience with infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Key Metrics for SRE and SLAs

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Research and identify key metrics used in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to measure system reliability, availability, and performance.
2. Choose two large companies or organizations known for their robust systems and search for their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or publicly available reliability metrics.
3. Create a Markdown file named "SREMetricsAndSLAs.md" in the lab5 folder and provide the following information:

   - List and explain the key metrics used in SRE.
   - Share the SLAs or reliability metrics you found for the two companies, along with any notable observations or insights.
   - Discuss the importance of these metrics and how they contribute to the overall reliability and performance of software systems.

4. Use your own words to describe the concepts and provide examples to support your explanations.

## Task 2: Terraform Installation and Nginx Deployment

To earn an additional 4 points, [follow these steps](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started) to install Terraform and deploy an Nginx container:

1. Read about Terraform.

2. Install Terraform:

   - Follow the appropriate instructions to install Terraform on your system.

3. Go through the tutorial steps:

   - Build infrastructure.
   - Change infrastructure.
   - Destroy infrastructure.
   - Define variables.
   - Query Data with Outputs.

4. Publish your configuration files, put them in the lab5 folder.
5. Document your installation and deployment process in a Markdown file named "TerraformAndNginx.md" in the lab5 folder and include the following details:
   - Include the version number of Terraform in your report.
   - The steps you followed to install Terraform.
   - The commands you executed to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration.
   - Any observations or challenges you encountered during the installation and deployment process.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore SRE metrics and SLAs to understand their importance in measuring system reliability. Additionally, gain hands-on experience with Terraform by provisioning infrastructure and deploying an Nginx container.
