### Purpose and benefits
Jenkins is a fundamental tool in DevOps for automating repetitive tasks and enabling faster, more reliable software delivery. It helps teams achieve continuous integration by automating the process of building and testing code changes. Jenkins also enables continuous delivery by automating deployment to various environments.

### Key features and functionalities
