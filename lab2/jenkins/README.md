# Jenkins
Jenkins is a server that helps to automate building, testing, deployment, and other processes. Because of that it's a popular tool among DevOps teams.

Jenkins can communicate with other programs such as build systems and testing. It can also execute scripts and create CI/CD pipelines.

## Example
Use Jenkins to run maven build.
