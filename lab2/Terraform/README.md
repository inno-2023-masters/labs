Terraform simplifies infrastructure provisioning and configuration by allowing to define a infrastructure state as code. It enables the creation, modification, and deletion of infrastructure resources in a easy, predictable and reproducable manner. 

## Key Features and Functionalities
- Open-source and free to use
- Uses a declarative configuration language to define infrastructure resources and their dependencies
- Supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more
- Provides infrastructure versioning, collaboration, and orchestration capabilities
- Terraform enables infrastructure provisioning, resource management, and infrastructure lifecycle management.

## Use Cases
Terraform can be used for scenarios such as creating virtual machines, configuring network resources, provisioning containers, and managing cloud services. It is helpful when a team needs to define and manage infrastructure resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.
