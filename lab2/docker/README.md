# Docker
Docker is a tool that automates deployments on platforms with containerization support. Containers are isolated from each other, but use the same OS kernel. This way it's uses less resources that virtual machines.

## DevOps
Docker is one of the most used tools in DevOps, because you can run containers on any machines that support it and it will work in almost the same way. It allows not to worry about compatibility while deploying software.
