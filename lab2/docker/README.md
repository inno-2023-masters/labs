## Tool name and description
Docker is a container platform, which is widely used in DevOps environment.

## Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context
Docker allows for much easier deployment of projects, at it provides tools to create, store and share closed virtual environments for software to run on.

## Key features and functionalities
Docker provides tools for creation and distribution of Docker containers. Docker container works somewhat similarly to a virtual machine, but instead of running virtual OS, it creates isolated processes on the host system, running software stored inside of the container. Docker containers allow for much easier deployment, as they store most of the required running environment inside them.

## Use cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios
Docker can be used to share an open-source application or service publicly. Instead of sharing the installation guide or executable, a Docker container could be shared. Any programmer can download the container, and run the application easily and safely.
Alternatively, Docker can be used to run microservices, as it allows for easily deployment of multiple applications with configurable interactions between them, as well as easy updates to individual containers, including tweaks to their environments.
