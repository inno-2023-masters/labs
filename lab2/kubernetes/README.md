Tool Name: Kubernetes
Description: Kubernetes is an open-source platform for orchestration that helps to automate management of containerised applications.

Purpose and Benefits: Kubernetes simplifies deployment and management of containerised applications, optimises resource utilisation, improves fault tolerance by handling failures and can scale the
containers based on demand.

Key Features and Functionalities:
- Orchestration of containers across different machines
- Adjusting the number of running containers based on workload
- Automatically recovering from failures by restarting failed containers and avoiding interrupts in service
- Even distribution of traffic accross the instances
- Service Discovery to help the containers to find and communicate with each other

Use-Cases: Airbnb has moves almost all online services from manually orchestrated EC2 instances to Kubernetes. Spotify and many other large companies also use Kubernetes for managing their containerised
applications to deploy microservices, be able to handle production workload, ensure elasticity and optimal performance with resource management and workload distribution, high availability and fault
tolerance with automated restart of failed containers.
