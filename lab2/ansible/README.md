# Ansible
Ansible is a tool for configuration management and deployment automation. It allows DevOps engineers to use infrastructure as code principle.

It doesn't require any programs on the hosts - ssh conectivity is enough to configure the hosts.

## Example use case
Let's say you have to configure hundreads of servers. It's hard and time-consuming to configure them manually, but with Ansible automations it's easy and fast.
