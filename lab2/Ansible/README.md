## Ansible

**Description**

Automation engine that is used for automating various IT processes such as application deployment, configuration management, provisioning and orchestration.

**Purpose and benefits**

 - Simplicity: simple and intuitive syntax
 - Automation: automates repetitive and manual tasks, allowing to focus on more important and strategic work
 - Scalability: parallel execution capability allows for scaling automation across a large number of hosts, making it suitable for managing complex and distributed environments
 - Infrastructure as Code
 - Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
 - Flexibility: supports a wide range of platforms. It can be used to manage both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure, providing flexibility in deployment scenarios.

**Key features and functionalities**

 - Agentless Architecture: uses SSH or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to connect to remote hosts, eliminating the need for installing and managing agents on those hosts
 - Declarative language: uses a simple and human-readable language called YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)
 - Idempotent execution: ensures idempotent execution, meaning that running the same playbook multiple times will always result in the same desired state, regardless of the initial state of the system. This helps in ensuring consistency and reliability.
 - Parallel execution: can execute tasks in parallel across multiple hosts
 - Extensibility: provides a rich set of modules that can be used to interact with various systems, services, and APIs. Additionally, custom modules can be developed to extend Ansible's capabilities
 - Integration with existing tools: can integrate with existing tools and workflows, making it easy to incorporate into existing DevOps toolchains
 - Role-based organisation: allows the organization of playbooks into reusable roles, which can be shared and reused across different projects or teams

**Real-world scenarios**

 - Compliance and Security: Ansible can help enforce security policies and compliance standards by automating the configuration and monitoring of security-related settings. It can perform regular audits and remediate any violations.
 - Disaster Recovery: Ansible can automate the recovery process in case of system failures or disasters. It can help in restoring backups, configuring failover systems, and recovering data and applications.
 - Application Deployment
 - Infrastructure Provisioning: Ansible can provision and configure infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, containers, and cloud instances. It can interact with various cloud providers' APIs to automate the creation and configuration of resources.
