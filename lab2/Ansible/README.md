# **Name:** Ansible

**Description:** Ansible is an open-source automation platform that simplifies the management and configuration of systems and applications.

**Purpose and benefits:** Ansible automates repetitive tasks, such as provisioning infrastructure, configuring servers, and deploying applications. It enables a declarative and infrastructure-as-code approach, facilitating the collaboration between development and operations teams and promoting consistent and scalable environments.

**Key features and functionalities:**
- Infrastructure Automation: Ansible can provision and configure infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, cloud instances, network devices, and more, using playbooks written in YAML.
- Configuration Management: It allows for the management of configurations across different systems, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.
- Application Deployment: Ansible can deploy applications to target servers, handling tasks like copying files, managing dependencies, and restarting services.
- Orchestration: Ansible enables the orchestration of complex workflows by defining dependencies and order of execution for multiple tasks or roles.
- Agentless Architecture: Ansible operates over SSH or other remote APIs, eliminating the need for agents to be installed on managed nodes.

**Use cases and examples:**
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Ansible can be used to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure resources, such as setting up cloud instances or virtual machines with the required software and configurations.
- Configuration Management: Ansible helps in managing and enforcing the desired state of system configurations, ensuring consistency and reducing drift between different servers or environments.
- Application Deployment and Rollback: Ansible playbooks can be used to deploy applications to multiple servers, handling tasks like copying files, managing dependencies, and restarting services. It also allows for easy rollbacks in case of issues or failures.
