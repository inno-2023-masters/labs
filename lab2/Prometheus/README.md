## Prometheus

**Description**

An open-source monitoring and alerting tool, provides a time-series database, a query language called PromQL, and a powerful alerting mechanism.

**Purpose and benefits**

 - Monitoring: monitor and collect metrics from various systems and services in real-time. It can scrape metrics from targets such as servers, containers, and applications, allowing you to gain visibility into the health and performance of your infrastructure
 - Alerting: a flexible and powerful alerting system that allows you to define alert rules based on thresholds and conditions
 - Time-series database: stores all collected metrics in a time-series database, which allows you to analyze and query the data using PromQL
 - Service discovery and dynamic configuration: supports service discovery mechanisms, such as DNS-based service discovery and integration with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. This allows automatically discover and monitor new instances of your services as they are added or removed. Additionally, Prometheus supports dynamic configuration, which means you can update the monitoring configuration without restarting the server
 - Integration with Grafana and other tools: Grafana allows you to create rich and customizable dashboards to visualize your Prometheus metrics. Furthermore, Prometheus has a rich ecosystem of exporters.

**Key features and functionalities**

 - Alerting
 - PromQL: its own query language
 - Scraping metrics: scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs, either directly or via an intermediary push gateway for short-lived jobs. It can collect metrics from various sources and supports the HTTP pull model
 - Visualization: graph specific queries is not a full-fledged dashboard tool. It is often used in combination with data visualization tools like Grafana to generate comprehensive dashboards and visualize the collected data
 - Time Series Database

**Real-world scenarios**

 - Container Orchestration Monitoring: it can collect metrics from Kubernetes clusters, monitor the health and performance of containers and pods, and provide visibility into the overall cluster health
 - Microservices Monitoring
 - Application Monitoring
 - Infrastructure Monitoring: Prometheus can monitor the health and performance of infrastructure components like servers, containers, and virtual machines
 - Cloud Monitoring: can be used to monitor cloud infrastructure and services
