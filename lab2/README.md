# Task 1: Research and Select Essential DevOps Tools
---

### 1. Git
This is an open-source version control tool that allows to track and manage changes to source code and for several developers to work on a single project. It greatly improves the development process and encourages multiple developers to collaborate. Its key features include version control - reverts, branching, merging, pushing, - and integration with other DevOps tools.

A typical use case: an independent developer wants to contribute to an open source project on git. One forks the source repository, adds his own piece of code, then makes a pull request to the main branch, thus contributing to the desired project.

### 2. Docker
This is an open source containerizaton tool that helps people build, test, and deploy applications. The tool features containers that have everything for the software to run. Such approach improves scalability, reduces microservices costs, simplifies application deployment.

Docker might be used when developers want to switch from monolith to microservices architecture. Docker will help break down the app into modular services and will pack them into a single container

### 3. Jenkins
This is an open source CI/CD automation tool that assists the software development process, including building, testing, and deployment. It allows managing jobs and pipelines and supports many plugins and integration with other DevOps tools.

Python developers might want to use Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery. For example, they will use nose2, pytest, or pylint plugins for executing unit tests and generating test reports which can be integrated directly into Jenkins for trending and reporting purposes.
