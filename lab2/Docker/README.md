# Docker:

## Tool name and description: 
Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate deployment and scaling of applications inside containers.

## Purpose and benefits: 
Docker simplifies process of creating, distributing and running applications in isolated containers. It provides a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier to deploy applications across different systems and platforms.

## Key features and functionalities:
- Containerization: Docker allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged into lightweight, portable containers.
- Image management: Docker provides a repository for storing and sharing container images, allowing easy distribution of applications.
- Resource efficiency: Docker containers consume fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines.
- Scalability: Docker enables horizontal scaling by allowing applications to be run in multiple containers.

## Use cases and examples:
- Docker can be used to package an application along with its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.
- It facilitates the creation of microservices architectures, where different components of an application are encapsulated within separate containers.
