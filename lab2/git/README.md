Tool name: Git
Description: Git is a distributed version control system that allows teams to effectively manage and track changes to source code.
Purpose and Benefits: Git provides a centralised repository for source code and makes it easier for developers to collaborate on code changes. It ensures version control and code integrity by allowing 
teams to track changes, create branches for features and releases, merge code, rollback to previous version.

Key Features and Functionalities:
- Allows to create branches and develop different features in different branches simultaneously
- Allows to merge changes in code to other branches including main which is helpful when the developer has finished the feature and it is ready for release
- Allows to have copies of repositories locally on your machine and work offline
- Tracks commits and allows to rollback changes and perform code review easier before merging

Use-Cases: Large companies like Microsoft and Google use Git for version control, managing features, releases, hotfixes with new branches, merging branches and collaboration between developers. Even Github
company uses Git for development of their product.
