# Research on IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol and network designed to create a distributed and decentralized version of the web. It is a peer-to-peer network that allows users to share and access files in a distributed way without relying on a central server. IPFS uses content-addressed storage and cryptographic hashes to ensure the integrity of data and make it tamper-proof. It also allows for faster and more efficient distribution of content, as files are cached and downloaded from the nearest nodes on the network.

# Exploring Fleek

Fleek is a hosting and deployment platform for decentralized applications and websites. It allows developers to easily deploy, host, and manage their projects on IPFS and the decentralized web. Fleek provides a range of features, including custom domains, SSL/TLS encryption, and CDN integration to improve website performance and security.

# Setting up the Project on Fleek:

To set up the project on Fleek, I followed these steps:

<ul>
  <li>Signed up for a Fleek account and verified my email address or using metamask account.</li>
  <li>Created a new project and linked it to my fork of the Labs repository on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Configured the project settings, including the build settings, custom domains, SSL/TLS encryption, and CDN integration.</li>
  <li>Deployed the project to Fleek, which automatically uploaded it to IPFS.</li>
</ul>

# IPFS Link and Custom Domain:

The IPFS link of the deployed project is: https://fleek.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbLop36MRnq1ww3tWkS1z8v6kstuuxfC3GdG6WzRNeLhr/

The custom domain used for the project is: (https://silent-glade-8755.on.fleek.co/)

# Observations and Insights:

Setting up the project on Fleek was a straightforward process, and the platform provided a range of useful features and settings to improve website performance and security. Uploading the project to IPFS was also effortless, and the content was immediately available on the network. Overall, Fleek seems like a useful platform for deploying and hosting decentralized applications and websites on IPFS and the decentralized web.
