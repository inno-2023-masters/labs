## Setup steps
To set up a project on Fleek, I did the following steps:
1. Sign up on Fleek.co using my Github account.
2. Authorized Fleek on my fork of labs repository, and selected it to be hosted on IPFS service.
3. Selected lab2 branch to be used.
4. Added a custom site name.
5. Ran the deployment and waited for it to finish.
6. PROFIT!!!
