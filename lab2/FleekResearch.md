- [Verify on IPFS](https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmcwqmVgiftQse2XygX3nK8bXYzxpy9GnvZEDQHsv9izMk)

## Observations
-- Fleek is a remarkably user-friendly platform that enables people to host web apps without having to set up servers or connections;
-- However, it only allows to host static web applications, which might be restrictive;
-- Also, I have attempted to modify the provided html file by inserting a link; but the website could not deploy after the change.
