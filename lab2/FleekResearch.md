## Steps to set up a project on Fleek
  - Sign in to your Fleek.co account or create a new account if you don't have one.
  - Click on the 'Create New Project' button to start setting up your project.
  - Choose the repository or codebase you want to deploy to Fleek.
  - Customize the build settings according to your project requirements.
  - After configuring the build settings, Fleek will build your project and generate a preview of how it will look when deployed.
  - If you have a custom domain you want to use, click 'Add Custom Domain' button in the project settings.
  - If SSL/TLS encryption is applicable to your project, you may need to provide an SSL certificate or use the automatic SSL feature provided by Fleek.
  - Fleek integrates with a CDN to ensure optimal content delivery and performance. CDN integration is often automatic, and Fleek handles it in the background.
  - Once you have completed the project setup and configuration, initiate the deployment process.
