# Fleek Research

I was on the lab and followed what Dmitry Creed was doing. I deployed what was on the *main* branch. Static *index.html* file.

Steps:
1. Connect to the github
2. Pick a repository
3. Choose the platform to host your site on: **Internet Computer** or **IPFS**. I chose the last one
4. Choose Build options and deploy
    - main branch
    - No framework 
    - No docker image
    - No build command
    - No custom Domain (SSL)

It was pretty easy to deploy a website using this tool. I have never heard about it and felt like future has come.

Overall, deploying a website using IPFS, as you did with Fleek.co and GitHub, offers advantages such as increased resilience, faster content delivery, and potential cost savings. It leverages the power of a decentralized network to provide a more efficient and reliable way of sharing and accessing web content
