# Fleek

## Steps:
1) Register to Fleek
2) Connect to Github
3) Choose repository
4) Choose settings
5) Deploy and wait
6) Profit!

## Settings:
Since my project is just a simple web page I didn't choose any settings 

## IPFS Link:
https://floral-snow-5462.on.fleek.co/

## Observations:
I had to deploy twice because my project had quite a lot of static content and Fleek couldn't immediately deploy in one try.
