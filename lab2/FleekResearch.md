## General steps to set up the project on Fleek.co

1. Sign up for a Fleek account.
2. Create a new project.
3. Choose any GitHub repository with static files as a source.
4. Choose the branch to deploy.
5. Set-up deploy settings in the project (I used default settings, IPFS Hosting Service).
6. Deploy the repository by pressing button.

# Observations
- Fleek is user friendly, so there is no problem to configure it even without comprehensive knowledge of IPFS protocol.
- Ability to host static web application for free is an amazing feature that I probably will use in some future projects.
