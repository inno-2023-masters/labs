## What is IPFS?

IPFS, or InterPlanetary File System, is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, similar to the World Wide Web, but with several key differences. IPFS is designed to be a peer-to-peer network, meaning that files are stored across many different computers rather than being centralized on one or a few servers. This makes IPFS more resilient to censorship and data loss, as there is no single point of failure in the network.

IPFS works by breaking files into small pieces, called "blocks," and then storing those blocks across multiple nodes in the network. When a user wants to access a file on IPFS, they send a request to the network to retrieve the blocks that make up that file. Because multiple nodes may have copies of the same blocks, the network can retrieve them quickly and efficiently. Once a user has retrieved all the blocks that make up a file, they can assemble them into the original file and use it as they would any other file.

## What is the purpose of IPFS?

- Peer-to-peer (P2P) network protocol: IPFS is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
- Utilize content-addressing: IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.
- Non centralized server: IPFS allows users to host and share files on a peer-to-peer network, without the need for a centralized server.
- Protocol: IPFS is a protocol, not a piece of software.

## What are the benefits of IPFS?

- Resilience: IPFS is a peer-to-peer network that stores files across many different computers, making it more resilient to censorship and data loss.
- Content-addressed storage: IPFS stores files based on a unique identifier, or "content hash," derived from the contents of the file itself. This makes it easier to share and verify files, and ensures that they are always available as long as at least one node in the network has a copy.
- Decentralization: IPFS provides a decentralized storage system, which means that there is no single point of failure in the network.
- Efficient retrieval: Because multiple nodes may have copies of the same blocks, IPFS can retrieve them quickly and efficiently.
- Potential use cases: IPFS has many potential use cases, including decentralized web hosting, peer-to-peer content sharing, and distributed applications.
- Openness: By providing a decentralized, content-addressed storage system, IPFS aims to create a more open internet where content can be shared freely.
- Censorship-resistance: Because IPFS is decentralized, it is more difficult for governments or other entities to censor content on the network.
