# Task 2

## Steps to set up the project
### Main steps
1. Create Fleek account and log in
2. Create a new project
3. Connect the GitHub account and select target repositry
4. Choose the branch to deploy
5. Set up deploy settings for the project (default settings are ok)
6. Verify the project is deployed using deploy log

### I also tried to setup custom domain
1. Create custom subdomain `lab2.devops2` for domain `alex-pirogov.ru`
2. Add custom domain into project settings
3. Add CNAME record for subdomain `lab2.devops2` pointing to `49b525f2077d263274b5.b-cdn.net` as Fleeks's docs says
4. Verify DNS
5. However htis didn'w work out :( Website is not available, maybe it'll become available later

# Observations
- Custom domain is not working and the reason is not obvious
