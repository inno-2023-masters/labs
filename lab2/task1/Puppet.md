# Puppet

## Description
Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that automates the provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. It uses a declarative language to define the desired state of the system and ensures that the infrastructure remains in that desired state.

## Purpose and Benefits
Puppet simplifies the management of complex IT infrastructure by providing a centralized platform for configuration management. It helps DevOps teams ensure consistency, repeatability, and scalability in the deployment process. The benefits of Puppet include reducing manual effort, enforcing configuration standards, enhancing system stability, and enabling rapid and reliable infrastructure changes.

## Key Features and Functionalities
1. Declarative Language
2. Infrastructure as Code
3. Resource Management
4. Orchestration and Automation
