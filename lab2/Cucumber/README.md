## Tool name and description

   Cucumber is a popular test automation framework used for behavior-driven development (BDD).
   It allows testers, developers, and business stakeholders to collaborate and define application behavior using a simple, human-readable language called Gherkin.

## Purpose and benefits

   The Cucumber framework makes it possible to write automated tests in plain-text that non-technical stakeholders can understand.
   These tests are designed in a behavior-driven manner, emphasizing the intended behavior and results of the software rather than the specifics of its implementation.

## Key features

- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in automation tests
- Human-Readable Scenarios
- Multiple langugages support
- Out of the box reports

## Use cases

   Using the Cucumber we can create the scenario like the following:

- GIVEN User is on log-in page
- WHEN User types his username and password
- AND Press "Enter" button
- THEN User successfully logged-in to the system

This scenario is understandable for non-technical employees, in addition, scenarios can be written in BDD format in the requirements for the system. Then we can run all the written test case in the automated pipeline and observer the reports.
