## Description:
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.

## Purpose and Benefits:
Kubernetes is designed to simplify the management of containerized applications at scale. It provides features for deploying, scaling, and monitoring containers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Kubernetes enables teams to efficiently manage complex application deployments in a cloud-native environment.

## Key Features and Functionalities:
  - Automated container deployment, scaling, and load balancing.
  - Self-healing capabilities to maintain application availability in the event of failures.
  - Service discovery and networking for communication between containers.
  - Horizontal scaling and rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.

## Use Cases and Examples:
  - Orchestrating and managing microservices architectures with multiple containers.
  - Running scalable web applications that handle varying traffic loads.
  - Automating the deployment and management of applications in cloud environments.
