# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is open source software for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

## Purpose and benefits

1. Containerization of the existing apps. Such modernization lets you develop faster.
2. Load balancing. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
3. Service health monitoring. Kubernetes is able to constantly run user-defined health checks over dockers and restart/kill/replace them if needed.

## Key features

Portability, Auto-scaling, Declarative model, Observability

## Use-cases

1. Large Scale App Deployment. Due to high scalability and automation, Kubernetes is a good choice for this task.
2. Big Data Processing. That task requires portable and repeatable apps.
3. Machine learning. Automated resource allocating is essential for this task.
