# Task 1

## Tool name and description

   GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides a complete end-to-end solution for the software development lifecycle.

## Purpose and benefits

   The main purpose is to provide tools to support version control, CI/CD features and developers collaboration.

## Key features

- Git Repository Manager
- Collaboration and Code Review
- CI/CD tools

## Use cases

   In my project we use Jira + GitLab combination. In Jira ticket we create the branch and then all the commits/merge request done in the GitLabs also shown in the Jira. Thus you can see the changes done in each ticket. Secondly, we use automaticly triggered pipelines to depoy the changes to dev env and make static testing for our code.
