# CI/CD Lab - GitHub Actions

## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

1. I perform the following actions:
   - Created a .github/workflows directory
   - In the .github/workflows directory, created a file named github-actions-demo.yml
   - Copied contents from the tutorial into the yml file
   - Push the branch to remote repo

## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

- I created new file for gather system information, i used "on: [workflow_dispatch]" and i used pre-defined actions "kenchan0130/actions-system-info@master".
- I faced one issue that i could not see my new action until i did lab9 branch as a default branch in my repo.
