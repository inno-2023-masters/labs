## Artifact Registries Research

### AWS Artifact Registries

AWS CodeArtifact is an artifact repository service and AWS Artifact is a compliance portal for accessing to AWS security and compliance reports.

### GCP Artifact Registries

GCP Artifact Registry is a single place for an organization to manage container images and language packages. It is fully integrated with Google Cloud's tooling and runtimes and comes with support for native artifact protocols.

### Azure Artifact Registries

Azure Artifact is a service that you can use to create and share Maven, npm, NuGet, and Python package feeds from public and private sources. Your packages can be used in Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server (TFS), Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps Server, and Jenkins.

### Differences between Artifact Registries

- AWS Artifact is primarily focused on providing compliance-related artifacts.
- GCP Artifact Registry is a fully managed service that supports both Docker and Maven repositories. It integrates well with other GCP services, and provides built-in vulnerability scanning for container images.
- Azure Artifacts is a package management service that supports multiple package types. It integrates well with other Microsoft services such as Azure DevOps and Visual Studio, and provides features such as access control and feed management.

## Serverless Computing Platform Research

### AWS Serverless Computing Platform

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.

### GCP Serverless Computing Platform

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment.

### Azure Serverless Computing Platform

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Azure Functions supports triggers, which are ways to start execution of your code, and bindings, which are ways to simplify coding for input and output data.

### Differences between Serverless Computing Platforms

- AWS Lambda has the most mature platform with the largest ecosystem of third-party tools and integrations.
- GCP Cloud Functions has a strong focus on event-driven computing and integrates well with other GCP services such as Pub/Sub and Firestore. It also has built-in support for some popular Node.js frameworks.
- Azure Functions has strong integration with other Microsoft services such as Azure Event Grid and Azure Cosmos DB.
