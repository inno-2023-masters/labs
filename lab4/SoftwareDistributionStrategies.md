Sorry for files from the first lab being in that branch. I messed up with the first lab and now it is in all other branches.
## Software Distribution

It is the procedure of distributing software updates and applications to end consumers.
This process is essential for secure and timely delivery of software to users.

## Strategies

1. Open-source distribution. In that case software is available for free and can be modified and
redistributed by users through their channels and repositories.
2. Freemium distribution. Similar to open-source, this strategy refers to freely available software.
However, it is not open-source and monetizes itself via additional paid features, functionalities, etc.
3. Software as a Service distribution. In that strategy customer can use, but not download your software product.
But in order to access software, user needs to pay for subscription. That strategy allows you to predict future revenue
of your company.

## Best practices

1. Implementing a continuous automated delivery. Automation of delivery can reduce overall
delivery-related work and increase consistency.
2. Security measures. Implement secure distribution practices to protect software from unwanted access or modification.
3. User reviews and analytics. Collect user feedback and study usage information to improve the functionality and usability of the software.
4. Data-Driven Approach. Carefully collect quantitative deployment metrics to measure them and improve process.
