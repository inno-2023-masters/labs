# Software Distribution Strategies

---

## Definition

Software distribution is a collection of methods
to deliver application and its updates to end user.

It is important because it is necessary to provide
safe and convenient product to endusers.
For example, in case of crucial vulnerability of application,
it is necessary to provide hot fix patch to users
as soon as possible.

## Strategies

- **Physical media distribution** is a software distribution
 that uses physical devices to distribute an apllication.
 Because of this, speed of distribution are low. Moreover,
 it is necessesary to provide protection of physical device
 that used to ditribute app. Usually, easier to distribute
 in local areas with low amount of clients.

- **Online distribution using websites** is a software distribution
 that uses the Internet to ditribute application. Because of this,
 speed of ditribution is high, but it is necessary to open website
 to get an application of update of application. However,
 there could be fraud links of the copy of website
 that could ditribute viruses instead.

- **App store distribution** is a software distribution that uses
 some app store to distribute applications. Usually, owners of
 app store are responsible for availability of product for users.
 At the same time, developers should be authorized and their applications
 should be checked before being available in the store. This is decrease
 number of viruses in store. It also helps to deliver updates in fast way

- **Package managers** are software distribution that are used for
 managing software product on computer. It is easier to ditribute and
 update an application using package manager because developers
 could not think about ditribution problems.

## Best Practices

- To find bugs and security issues it is essential to have
 form for users to report crashes and bugs. Also, it is necessary
 to monitor resources to prevent system overload.

- Version Control System is necessary nowadays because it allows
 programmers to work efficiently together and effectively deliver
 updates to endusers

- Security measures are necessary for users to be able
 to secure confidantial information. For example, to use
 secured connection for authorization.
