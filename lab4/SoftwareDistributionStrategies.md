# Software Distribution Strategies

## Definition of software distribution and its significance

Software distribution is the process of delivering software to users. It is a very important part of the software development lifecycle, since if the product is not delivered properly and efficiently, it might as well not exist.

## Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics

1. **Physical distribution** - distribution using disks, USB drives, etc. It is mostly moved away from nowadays, as it is not efficient and requires a lot of resources.
2. **Online distribution** - distribution using the internet. It is the most common way of distributing software nowadays, as it is efficient.

6. **Source code distribution** - distribution using source code. It is a common way of distributing software for open source projects.
7. **Binary distribution** - distribution using binaries. It is a common way of distributing software for closed source projects.

## Best practices for software distribution

1. **Version control** - software versions should be managed carefully to ensure that users have access to the latest stable version and that updates are delivered efficiently.
2. **Release management** - software releases should be planned and managed carefully to ensure that they are delivered on time.
3. **User feedback and analytics** - to improve the quality of software, developers must collect and analyze user feedback and usage data.
4. **Security measures** - software should be protected against security threats, such as malware and data breaches.
5. **Documentation and support** - software should be accompanied by documentation and support to help users understand how to use it.
6. **Automation and continuous delivery** - software should be delivered automatically and continuously to ensure that users have access to the latest stable version.
