## Software Distribution
**Software Distribution** is a process of delivering your software to users. 

**Software Distribution strategies**
- *Physical*: deliver software by CD, DVD disks, flash drivers, etc.
- *Packet managers*: download your software to PyPI which users will download via pip.
- *Stores*: Upload your software to different stores (Google Play, App Store, Steam, etc.).
- *Online site*: You can create and upload your software to the web-site.
- *Source code*: You can upload your source code to an open platform (GitHub) and users will download it.

**Best Practices**
- *CD*: All applied software updates which passed testing and building should be automatically delivered to the production.
- *Documentations and support*: Software should be well documented and developer should provide the support in case of bugs found.
- *Version control*: Developer should manage version updates and file changes
