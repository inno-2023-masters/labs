# Software Distribution (Amirlan Sharipov)

Software Distribution is the process of delivering the software and its updates to the end user.
One common way in the past was distribution through CD, DVD, and other physical devices.
Now it's more popular to distribute software through "App stores", but there are other ways like package managers, online download of binary or installation files, etc.
But many programs use several ways of distribution. For example, Firefox can be found on many linux distributions through their native package manager, flatpak, snap, but it's also available on AppStore and PlayMarket for mobile devices.
App stores and package managers allow users to easily update the software, while downloading the software through web browser every time it receives an update in inconvenient.

## Best practices
- Version control: manage version so that updates are received efficiently
- Secure distribution
- Documentation and Support
- Continuous Delivery: automate the deployment and distribution
