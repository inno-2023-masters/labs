# Task 1: Research Software Distribution Strategies
---
Software distribution is the process of delivering software applications to end users, including packaging all nevessary files and making it available for download and installation.

Its main significance is to create opportunity to make software applications available to any user. 

There are three main distribution strategies:
- Web downloads from websites/online platforms. It is the easiest and most popular way distribution right now.
- Physical distribution via CDs. This strategy was very popular earlier, when internet connectivity was limited
- Software as a Service. Software is hosted on a single cloud storage and is accessed by users as a subscription-based service. 

Best practices for software distribution include:
- delivering regular updates
- providing documentation (installation guides, manuals, or release notes) and support
- supporting user security and privacy
