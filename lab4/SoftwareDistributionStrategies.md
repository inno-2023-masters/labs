## Definition of software distribution and its significance
Software Distribution is a process of delivering software from the developer to users. It is an important part of the lifecycle of many software products, since it significantly affects coverage and costs of a product.

## Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics
- Physical media

    The oldest way of software distribution was physical mediums like optical disks, diskettes, cassettes or, more recently flash drives. This is the most reliable way of software distribution, but the most expensive one.

- Website downloads

    With the internet becoming more widespread (and CD drives becoming a rarity) developers started to distribute software using website downloads. This is a cheaper alternative to physical drives.

- App markets or Package managers

    App markets and Package managers take the online distribution a step further, by incorporating special platforms that provide access to variety of different applications, as well as automatically manage all the requirements and installation process, as well as updates. This however, hinders the user's ability to fine-tune the install process.

- Open-source

    Another way of web distribution, commonly used by free and public projects is Open-source distribution. In that case, the sources of the software is shared, so anyone can build the software locally. This methods helps the collaboration immensely, but is inconvenient to low-level users.

- Web-deployment

    Many software projects are distributed as web applications, that can be accessed like any webpage with a browser, requiring no download or install. This method is very common these days, but it is completely dependent on internet access, since no copy of software is stored locally.

## Best practices for software distribution
In 2023, I personally find Physical media obsolete, many PCs these days don't even have a CD drive.

Open-source distribution is really inconvenient, since often times you have to download and install special build tools and libraries that might be as large as the app itself, if not larger.

Depending on platform, I would say that following practices are the best for software distribution:

Windows
- Website downloads - Windows has always relied on .exe or .msi installers and they remain convenient to this day.
- Web-deployment - Modern PC browsers support a multitude of features to make web applications convenient to use.

Linux
- Package Managers - Linux has very good support for package managers (apt, snap, etc.) and for system designed around command prompt, it is the most convenient option.
- Open-Source - Linux core idea is open source, and it comes with a great selection of tools for building and running those apps efficiently. And being an OS for nerds, skill is not an issue with Linux.

MacOS/Android
- App Markets - App Markets are the best way to distribute software to low-level users of mobile devices and Apple products, as they provide automated install and easy updates.
- Web-deployment - Web deployment is often as good for mobile as for PC, since both of them have web-browsers and internet access. The support for mobile platform is varying on app to app basis though.
