Software distrubution is the process of delivering the software product to the users.

Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics:
1. Physical media: for example software is burned onto a CD disk or shared via a USB, very useful in situation when there is no internet access since the software can be installed/reinstalled offline. However, if the physical media is corrupted and there is no online version available for download, it may be difficult to restore the access to the distribution (e.g. find a new disk)
2. App stores: stores designed specifically to distribute software from developers. Using such platforms, the users can easily search for necessary apps and install them securely. Also, they can add reviews. The marketplace usually contains free and paid version of software (depends on the store and the developer).
3. Online downloads: the users can download software directly from websites, usually it is packaged as some kind of executables (.exe, .apk, .dmg). These files are usually hosted on the developers' servers. The software can be distributed for free or via subscription model or one-time payment.
4. Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service: software is hosted and accessed via internet, usually users subscribe to a service for a fee to access it. The benefits are that the users don't need to maintain the software and can pay depending on their use, also scale quickly if necessary (e.g. AWS).
5. Package managers: allow to manage the distribution on a particular operating system or distribution, usually have console-based interface (e.g. npm, apt). Simplify the process of managing dependencies and ensure consistent and efficient software installation across different systems.
6. Containers: the application and its dependencies are bundled together into a container image so it allows for portable installation, usually the images can be accessed via some repository (e.g. Docker hub). Containers provide an isolated and portable runtime environment that ensures consistency and reproducibility across different systems.
7. Source code: providing the source code of the product which can be modified and maintained by the users. The drawback is that deployment can be difficult, especially if the code was not properly tested for some platforms. Also, the deployment may be challenging, especially if the users do not have good technical expertise.
8. Binaries: precompiled executable files, the software is compiled and packaged into binary files that are ready to be executed on the target platform without the need for further compilation or source code.

The best practices of software distribution include:
- clear and easy-to-understand documentation
- version control to manage different versions of software with updates
- updates to fix emerging issues or release new features
- continuous delivery to automate and streamline the process of deployment and delivery
- support over different channels to assist the users in installing the system
- secure licensing to protect from unathorised access and ensure compliance with licensing terms
- multiple distribution channels so that users can choose the most convenient for them and have alternatives
- user-friendly installation process
- testing for compatibility before releasing a new isssue to ensure that the new version will work without issues on different types of devices
- analysis of user feedback to constantly improve
