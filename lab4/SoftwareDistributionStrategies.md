### Definition and significance

Software distribution is the process of delivering or deploying software applications and updates to end-users or computers within an organization 
It involves the preparation, packaging, testing, and delivery of software to users or machines that will use it. The significance of software
distribution is to ensure that software is installed and updated correctly, with minimal disruption to user productivity and system availability. 
Effective software distribution can improve productivity, security, and reduce costs by automating software delivery, patching, and simplifying 
the overall process of managing and supporting software within an organization.

### Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics

Several software distribution strategies exist, and the choice of strategy often depends on the organization's size and complexity, 
the nature of the software being deployed, and the distribution channels. Here are some of the common software distribution strategies:

 - Direct download and installation: This is the most basic distribution strategy, where the user downloads the software from the vendor's
website and installs it manually.
 - Physical media: Here the software is distributed on a physical medium like CD/DVD and shipped to the user. This method is less common these days.
 - Network installation: In this method, organizations host the software applications on a network share, and users can install the software from the provided share.
 - Push installation: Here, the IT administrator deploys the software remotely to the end-user's computer without user intervention.
 - Automated deployment: Organizations can deploy software automatically using software deployment tools that can automate the entire process.

### Best practices for software distribution

 - Define software distribution policies that align with organizational policies and goals.
 - Utilize automation to streamline the software distribution process and reduce errors.
 - Test software before deployment to identify and resolve any compatibility issues.
 - Monitor software deployments to ensure that deployment is successful and that issues are resolved promptly.
 - Plan properly to scale software distribution as the organization grows.
