# Task 1: Research Software Distribution Strategies

## Software distribution
Software distribution refers to the process of delivering software applications to end-users or customers. It involves packaging, delivering, and installing software on target systems. 

## Software distribution strategies
1. Physical media distribution using CDs, DVDs, or USB drives. It can be useful in areas with limited or unreliable internet access. But it is costly and it may become outdated quickly, requiring frequent updates.
2. Web downloads from websites or online platforms. It can reach a global audience quickly and cost-effectively.
3. App stores. Software is distributed through dedicated app stores, such as Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. App stores provide a centralized platform for users to discover, download, and install software. But it has a lot of restrictions for developers.
4. Software as a Service (SaaS). Software is hosted on cloud infrastructure and accessed by users over the internet on a subscription basis. It eliminates the need for software distribution as users access the software directly through web browsers or dedicated applications. It offers scalability, automatic updates, and seamless user experiences. Disadvatages are security, availability and privacy concerns.

## Best practices
- version control
- release management
- analyze user feedback
- high security
- clear documentation and support 24/7
- automatin and CI/CD with frequent changes
