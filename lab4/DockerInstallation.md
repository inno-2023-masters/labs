# Docker and Docker Compose installation

## Installation commands

To install Docker, I used command "pip install docker". To install Docker Compose, I used command "pip install docker-compose".

## Docker and Docker Compose version

Then I used command "docker --version" to check the version of Docker and command "docker-compose --version" to check the version of Docker Compose.
docker --version gave this output: Docker version 23.0.5, build bc4487a
docker-compose --version gave this output: Docker Compose version v2.17.3

## Observations and challenges

The installation is really simple and straightforward. I didn't encounter any challenges during the installation process.
I've used Docker before, so I had Docker Desktop already installed on my computer.
