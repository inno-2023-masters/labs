## Observations and Challenges

During the installation process, I encountered the following:

- **Internet connectivity**: Initially, I faced slow network connectivity, resulting in a significantly prolonged download time for Docker and Docker Compose packages. It is highly recommended to ensure a stable internet connection when downloading these packages to avoid potential delays.

- **System compatibility**: Docker and Docker Compose have specific system requirements that need to be met. It is crucial to verify that your operating system is supported and meets the necessary prerequisites before proceeding with the installation. See the official [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for more information.

- **Administrative privileges**: I encountered this challenge while assisting a friend who uses a Mac laptop. We had to use the `sudo` command before executing the installation commands. Depending on your operating system, administrative privileges may be required to install Docker and Docker Compose. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions or administrative access to successfully complete the installation.

- **Pip installation**: In order to install Docker and Docker Compose, I had to ensure that `pip` was installed on my system. If `pip` is not already installed, it can be installed using package managers like apt or Homebrew, depending on your operating system. However, I installed `pip` using the following commands:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```
