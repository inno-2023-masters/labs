# Docker Installation

---

## Installing Docker

Installing Docker in Linux Mint. Since `pip` is preinstalled
I just wrote `pip install docker` to install Docker

My version of Docker:
`Docker version 20.10.21, build 20.10.21-0ubuntu1~22.04.3`

## Installing Docker-Compose

Just typed `pip install docker-compose`

Version of docker-compose:
`docker-compose version 1.29.2, build unknown`

## Observations

Docker installation is much simpler if you use package manager
`pip` that install it by hands (As I did for Windows).
