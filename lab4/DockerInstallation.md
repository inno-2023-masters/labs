# Docker (Amirlan Sharipov)
I already have docker installed through my package manager (pacman). It's possible to install docker and docker compose using pip with pip install docker and pip install docker-compose. One thing worth noting is that you have to add your user to docker group to use docker properly. Otherwise, it's possible to use it as root user.
