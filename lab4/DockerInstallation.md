## Docker Installation :

### My computer specifications:

- Computer type: PC
- Operating system: Microosft Windows 11

### CASE: Using PIP :

To Install Docker using pip, the prerequisite was to have python installed on the system.

1. On the terminal I typeed-in the following command:

```sh
    pip install docker
```

2. To install Docker-compose, on the terminal I used the following command:

```sh
    pip install docker-compose
```

3. Verifying the installation, to check docker was well installed I used the following command

```sh
    docker --version
```

> "docker --version" command revealed my docker version is 20.10.24, build 297e12
