## Task 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose

I have Docker on my laptop already. I installed it a long time ago using Homebrew (`brew install docker`)

My version is 4.17.0 (99724).

Hovewer, if you wanna install it using pip, there are steps to do it:
1. `pip install docker`
2. `pip install docker-compose`

It gives you opportunity to run docker commands from Python.
It is simple to install if you use MacOS or Windows.
