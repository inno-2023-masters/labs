# DevOps in Practice

## Use Case Scenario

A cross functional team is responsible for the development and maintenance of an e-learning platform. The team comprises of developers, testers and operations engineers. Developers are in charge of writing code, testers run test cases and operations managing releases and monitoring.

There are several potential challenges that can hinder productivity and delivery of our software product, in this case an e-learning platform. Some of these challenges are:

#### Miscomprehension and misunderstanding between team members:

In a cross functional team like the one in this scenario, where there is lack of clear communication between team members, there would be a lot of misunderstand around processes. Applying the cultural habit of effective communication would help clear out such issues.

#### Bugs and errors crashing the codebase or application:

If developers have the tendency to finish coding a whole feature before committing and pushing it to the main repository, this can lead to faulty application. Debugging becomes a nightmare since as they have to go through thousand lines of code and test cases to identify the bugs. This can we very time consuming. To avoid this, it is important to ideally breakdown tasks into micro tasks and to do frequent commits continuously.

#### Slow productivity (delivery process):

If the developers, testers, and operation engineers do not streamline an optimized and automated delivery process, features delivery will be slow and time consuming. To enhance productivity, tasks that are generally repeated can be automated through scripts and using an appropriate infrastructure.

## Solutions to Challenges

From these list of potential challenges, we can clearly spot out DevOps principles and practices that can mitigate the potential issues.

#### Communication and Collaboration

This is definitely the best way to avoid conflict and misunderstanding. Effective communication, regular scrum meetings, documentation and use of processes canvas would help each and everyone understand what is going on their role in the processes.

#### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration habits (frequent commit and merges) is a good practice that helps to detect bug in early stages of development.

#### Continuous Delivery

Combined to Continuous integration in a pipeline, continuous delivery practices automate testing, as the application moves from development branch to staging and then production. This speeds up the whole delivery process.
