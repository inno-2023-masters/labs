# DevOps, Lab1, Task 2

## Scenario: recent release done by dev team produced a bug

## Practices:
1. Through applying **continuous monitoring** DevOps team identifies that the bug is encoutered by users of the system through alerting.

2. Using **continious collaboration and communication** DevOps team helps dev team to localize bug providing complete logs, tracebacks ond other required data.

3. Using **automation of the SDLC** DevOps team ensures that tests that were written by devs for this bug after fixing it would be executed before every further release is approved.
