# Scenario

The ETL development team at ABC Enterprises is responsible for building and maintaining a suite of ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into the data warehouse. The ETL development team has faced a number of challenges in meeting the performance and reliability requirements of the ETL pipeline.  

## The challenges 

• The ETL pipelines often run into performance bottlenecks due to code bottlenecks in data transformation and component selection.

• The development and testing of ETL pipelines often takes longer due to the manual processes involved in releasing the ETLs into the production environment.

• Longer delays in deploying new updates and bug fixes to existing ETL pipelines due to the manual update process and lack of automation.

## DevOps practices used by ETL team 

## 1. Continuous Integration (CI):
By making the processs of building, testing and deploying ETL pipelines automate can help the ETL team reduce delays in deploying new updates and bug fixes. As CI can detect errror in code early and allow team to quickly fix and push changes to production.

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Iac can help the ETL team create consistent, repeatable, and reliable environments for testing and deploying ETL pipelines. The ETL team can also respond more quickly to any changes in infrastructure that can impact performance and reliability.

## 3. Automated Testing:
This can ETL team to automatically test the code and components of each ETL pipeline. This can identify any errors in data transformation or component earlier on in the process. This practice can help the ETL team meet the performance and reliability requirements of the ETL pipeline in a timely manner.
