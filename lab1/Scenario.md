# Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario
---

## Scenario
A very big team is working on a game project. The people from the team face multiple challenges; different de-centralized subdivisions work on different aspects of the game, and communication between them is poorly organized. Moreover, deployment process is not automated, so each time a new version is made, it has to manually deployed to production. As a result, the team suffers from not having a clear objective and mismanagement; the company loses audience, fame, and money due to delayed and unstable game updates.

## Solution
Such a company clearly suffers from inadequate management and it would certainly enjoy multiple DevOps practices:
-- Continuous Planning. The team does not have an established team leader who would define a clear plan of action and adjust it to changing conditions.
-- Building a Collaborative Culture. Encouraging the subdivisions of the team to communicate and collaborate would certainly help improve the overally productivety.
-- Continuous Delivery. The deployment team might use a CD tool to automate the deployment process. Such change will ensure that the deployment process is fast, consistent, and error-proof.
