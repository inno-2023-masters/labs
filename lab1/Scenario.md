# Scenario
A group of developers are working on a forum website. They have separate development, test and operational teams. Their product is actively evolving and improving as their target auditory grows. However, with the inevitable growth of their team and size of their code base, their deveopment processes slow down making them less able to adapt.

# Resolution
## Communication and collaboration
Improving communication between teams working on the project would allow them to continue to work effectively with the growth of their staff. Tight communication between Test and Development teams would allow developers to focus on more important issues, while better integration between Development and Operations teams would make deployment and administration easier.

## Continuous Delivery and Deployment
As the project and its codebase are constantly improved and changed, the Operations team are focused on keeping the production running on the most recent version. Automating those processes would allow Operations team to focus on more important tasks and to reduce the load on its members.

## Continous Feedback
Management of feedback data fed to the development team would allow them to focus on the most important issues and to provide most wanted improvements faster, rather than working on useles or unimportant features, as well as allowing them to respond quickly to critical issues.

## Infrastructure as code
Since the forum database has large audience and huge amounts of active users, it probably has a large infrastructure, which also require managemnt. Implementing Infrastructure as code paradigm would allow Operations team to manage the servers more effeciently and to ensure stable operation of their site.
