## Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario

Let's say freshmen came up together and decided to create a middle sized app. Previously they had an experience writing a small pet projects on their own. 

### During development process thei faced following challanges:

- **Manual and Inconsistent Deployments**: deployments to production are done manually by individual team members. They have undocmented steps. Hence, this leads to inconsistencies in the deployment process and increases the chances of errors

- **Lack of Collaboration and Communication**: the development and operations teams work separately. They have poor collaboration and communication. There is a lack of shared understanding, resulting in delays, misunderstandings.

- **Slow Feedback Loop**: the team relies on manual testing, and it takes a considerable amount of time to run tests and provide feedback on code changes. This slows down the development process and prevents quick iterations and improvements


### To fix it, they could use the following DevOps principles and practices:

- **Automation and Consistency**: implementing CI/CD pipelines will automate the deployment process, enabling consistent and reliable deployments

- **Collaboration and Communication**: encouraging collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, such as through regular standup meetings, shared goals will help overcome the challenge of poor collaboration and communication

- **Autotesting**: introducing automated testing practices, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, will help reduce the time to get feedback
