## Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario

Scenario: A software development team is working on a complex web application but faces challenges with security flaws and slow feature delivery.

We can apply the following practices:

1. **CI/CD**: By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, CI/CD ensures that code changes are integrated and tested frequently. This reduces the time and effort required to deliver new features. It also helps identify and fix issues early in the development cycle, minimizing the chance of introducing bugs and security flaws into production.
2. **DevSecOps**: DevOps Security promotes continuous security testing alongside other automated testing practices. Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code analysis are automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipelines. This ensures that security checks are performed regularly, providing feedback on potential vulnerabilities and allowing to fix them timely.
3. **Automated Testing**: Automating tests helps the team catch bugs and issues early in the development process. By running automated tests continuously, the team can quickly identify regressions or issues introduced by new code changes. This ensures the stability and security of the software, allowing the team to release new features confidently and frequently.
