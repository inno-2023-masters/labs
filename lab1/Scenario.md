For example there could be a fictional company working on a web e-commerce application. They could face the following problems:
- integration issues: the team consists of multiple developers working on different features simultaneously, however, when it comes to integrating their changes, conflicts arise, leading to delays and 
quality issues;
- slow and error-prone deployments: the deployment process is manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors, thus, new features and bug fixes take longer to reach production, affecting customer satisfaction;
- lack of collaboration: developers and testers collaborate very rarely because they live in different cities, resulting in a lack of shared understanding, delays in bugs and issues resolution, conflicts 
and decreased productivity.
 They could use the following practices to improve the situation:

- automation & efficiency: use git for managing code changes, set up CI/CD for automated builds, tests and deployments to ensure that no manual effort is spent on these activities, reducing potential 
errors and giving early feedback on potential errors, also reducing the delays between testing and deployment. Also they could use feature toggles in CD to try out new features and control their release. 
Besides, using IaC tools like Terraform could improve 
provisioning and management of infrastructure resources, saving time and reducing errors. For example, once the code passes the CI pipeline, it is automatically deployed to the staging environment. The 
deployment pipeline includes steps for running additional tests, validating the deployment, and enabling feature toggles. This allows the team to gradually roll out new features to a subset of users, 
ensuring a controlled release and the ability to gather feedback before a full production deployment.

- collaboration: they could set up collaboration tools like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Team and Miro to be able to have frequent calls and discuss issues and requirements often. For example, the team could 
establish a dedicated communication channel on Slack or Telegram where developers, testers, and operations engineers can discuss ongoing work, ask questions, and provide updates. They could hold daily 
stand-up meetings to synchronize efforts, share progress, and address any issues. This promotes collaboration, improves understanding, and enables quick issue resolution.

These activities will allow to improve code quality, lead to faster and reliable deployments and enhance collaboration and productivity.
