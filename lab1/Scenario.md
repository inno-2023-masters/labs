### A fictional team may face the following problems:
- **Alignment of goals and priorities:** the task that has the highest priority is handled by a minority, which leads to a delay in the release of the project.
- **Manual deployments and poor productivity:** the team is engaged in manual deployment and there is no automation of cyclical moments in development, which can lead to poor performance and an excessive number of human errors.
- **Outdated infrastructure:** the team is facing problems related to outdated infrastructure models, which can lead to stability problems and insufficient scalability.

### The potential benefits of applying DevOps principles and practices:
- By implementing DevOps, the team can facilitate better coordination and collaboration between teams from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to deployment and operation. This can be achieved through constant communication, sharing of responsibilities and a common understanding of customer needs.
- By automating deployments and repetitive actions, the team can save time and ensure consistent and reliable deployment.
- DevOps tools allow the team to quickly adapt to changing requirements and provide updates to applications and services at high speed.

### DevOps principles and practices:
- **Collaboration:** frequent communication helps to track progress in work, make specifics in priorities, better coordinate work and better understand customer needs. 
- **Automation:** automation reduces the number of human errors, increases productivity and simplifies the deployment process. This includes clarifying the roles performing deployments, optimizing the deployment process, and automating the process using appropriate tools.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** By implementing infrastructure as code, the team can automate infrastructure preparation and management, providing greater flexibility, scalability and reliability.
