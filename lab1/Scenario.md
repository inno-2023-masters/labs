## Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario

**Scenarios.** The development team writes part of the application code, after reaching a certain functionality sends it for testing (archive the code, a copy of the database, instructions for installing all the necessary software to run and work of the application). The QA expert unpacks the archive, installs everything needed on the test bench, deploys the application and tests it.  
**Problems №1.** If a new development version appears during testing, the whole procedure has to be repeated. As a result, the probability of errors increases, and the tester catches the same bugs several times.  
**Problem №2.** The launch of the feature is delayed.  
**Problem №3.** Versions may be incompatible in the test environment and on the customer's server. As a result, when another web server is used in production, software conflicts may occur - the application will have to be reconfigured.  
Without the `automation` and `collaboration` provided by DevOps, software development cycles can be much longer. And without `continuous testing` and `monitoring`, it's harder for teams to identify and fix problems.
