# 5 Key Principles of DevOps
DevOps now is more about phyloophy, mindset and cultureal shift rather than development and operation teams colaborative work

In a DevOps culture, engineers get closer to the user by better understanding their expectations and needs. Operations teams participate in the development process, adding maintenance requirements and customer requirements.

## Colaboaration
**Collaboration drives DevOps.** Development and operations teams work together throughout the development and deployment cycle, communicating and sharing feedback. Development and operations teams often merge to work across the application lifecycle.

DevOps teams ensure product quality in all areas. This encourages "full stack" development, where teams handle all aspects of a feature or product. Teams own a feature or project from idea to delivery. Team investment and attachment improves output.

## Automatization
**DevOps implies software development lifecycle automation.** Developers have more time to write code and add functionality. CI/CD pipeline automation reduces human errors and boosts team efficiency. Teams may swiftly respond to client input with continuous improvement and short iterations using automated methods.

## Continious imrovements
Continuous improvement and delivery allow DevOps teams to **push software upgrades that increase efficiency**. Teams push code changes that reduce waste, improve development productivity, and increase customer value due to the constant release process. 

## Customer-centric actions
DevOps teams produce user-centered products and services using short feedback loops with customers and end users. **Live monitoring and rapid deployment** enable real-time user feedback collection and reaction in DevOps. Teams can see how live people utilize a software system and enhance it. 

## Create with the end in mind
Understanding client demands and designing products that answer real problems is this concept. Teams shouldn't "build in a bubble" or base products on user usage assumptions. Instead, DevOps teams should understand the product from creation through implementation.
