# DevOps practices
## 1. Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is a DevOps practice where latest versions of the application are automatically built, tested, and prepared for final release. This ensures that developers have applications ready to be deployed at all times. (`Buddy`)

## 2. Communication
One of the key DevOps practices is communication between Dev and Ops parts of the team. It allows faster problem-solving and teaches everyone to share information and resources.(`DNG`, `RTC`)

## 3. Customer-Centric Decision Making
According to that principle, decisions should be evaluated with the great weight given to customer benefit. This helps guide development using customer feedback.(`tl;dv`, `HotJar`)

## 4. Continuous Monitoring
It is a practice of constant monitoring of product's security and performance metrics. The goal is to detect problems at the real time and fix them quickly.(`Prometheus`, `Zabbix`)

## 5. Infrastructure as Code
It is a practice of automation of development and testing processes via managing infrastructure using code. It involves building configs and scripts rather than manually configuring settings. (`AWS CloudFormation`)
