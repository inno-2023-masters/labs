## The core DevOps principles
**1. Continuous integration (CI)**

CI is a practice in which developers frequently commit code to a central repository by auto build and testing. This practice helps to detect bugs and error early and fix its.

**2. Continuous delivery/deployment (CD)**

Continuous delivery is the princliple in which we use automation to release updates of software up to the deployment stage. Continuous delivery follows CI, so software will automatically built and tested.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the princliple in which if code passed all automated tests, it will  be automatically deployed to production without human intervention.


**3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

IaC is a principal which automatically prepares infrastructure and management of it through code, replacing the manual processes.  IaC is required generated configuration file which store infrastructure specification.

**4. Monitoring**

Monitoring is a proactive actions to detect and resolve issues. Also monitoring can be automated processes and tooling which will be use to the same purpose


## DevOps practices
**1. Collaboration**

Collaboration is a practice that fostering effective working relationships between development and operations teams. 
For example, many companies use messagers for fast communication and discussion, and create regular meetings using video calls.

**2. Automation**

Automations is a practice that replace manual and/or repeated tasks with automated processes.
For example, using CI/CD tools in Gitlab, Github Actions, etc.

**3. Efficiency**

Efficiency is a practice which have purpose optimizing processes, reducing errors and increasing productivity. Efficiency have aspects as continuous improvement, optimization of resources and rationalization workflows.
For example, using container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes for optimizing resourse usage, manage and automating deployment.
