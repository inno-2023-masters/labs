# DevOps, Lab1, Task 1

## Core principles of DevOps:
1. **Continious collaboration and communication**

    DevOps team usually stays in the middle of operational unit which consists of dev, ops, sec and test teams. The team takes ownership of features or projects from idea to delivery, leading to higher-quality outcomes, which can be achieved only through effective communication.
    
2. **Automation of the SDLC**

    DevOps tries to automate as much of the SDLC as possible. Continuous integration automates the process of moving new code into existing code, while continuous deployment helps automate releases. And Infrastructure as Code makes it easy to automate the process of provisioning developer environments.

3. **Customer-based decision making**

    DevOps team prioritizes customer feedback, using short feedback loops and real-time monitoring to develop user-centered products and services. It collect and respond to feedback rapidly, providing immediate visibility into user interactions to development teams.

4. **Continuous Improvement and Monitoring**

    DevOps focuses on experimentation, waste reduction, and optimizing speed and value delivery. Team continuously updates software systems and gather metrics to eliminate waste.
