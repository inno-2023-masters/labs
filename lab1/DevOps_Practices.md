# Task 1: Research and Define DevOps Principles and Practices
---

The core practices of DevOps include:
- Continuous Planning. This practice helps teams plan and monitor the development processes continuously; it allows teams define a clear plan of action and adjust to changing conditions.

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. It involves validating changes, building and testing new versions of an application, and automated delivery. Such practice helps detect issues early in the development process, ensure high code quality and allows to make a release quickly.

- Monitoring the Right Metrics. It involves monitoring the performance of applications and infrastructure and logging all events for analysis. This helps identify issues, define new goals and objectives, and improve the overall performance.

- Building a Collaborative Culture. This principle encourages communication, collaboration, and working towards the same goal. In the long run, it improves productivety and meeting deadlines. 

- Gathering Continuous Feedback. Since DevOps includes lots of other components, having a feedback on the whole DevOps pipeline is essential. It helps optimize all the processes and improve the overall performance.
