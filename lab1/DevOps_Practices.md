## DevOps

---

DevOps is a set of practices and principles
that aimed to decrease effort and time spent on
delivering code to the production stage

Some core practices:

- Team work
- Automatization
- User feedback

### Team work

Team work and communication inside project members are crucial
for project success. First, communication between programmers.
The solution for it is version control applications such as Git.
For example, GitHub provides code sharing between programmers,
resolving conflicts, merging different versions of code.
[Amazon uses Git and Github](https://www.edureka.co/blog/companies-using-devops/#amazon)
for updating and sharing code

Second, communications between all project members.
It could be task assignments, (online) meetings and etc.
To perform assign tasks conveniently Github or Mira could be used.
For meetings and for other communications could be used almost
all messegers (for example, Telegram, Zoom, etc)

### Automatization

Decreasing of routine and repeatable work could decrease human factor
during checking for errors, increase efficiency of development
because, for example, programmers could focus other more important tasks.

For instance, automated tests for each commit in GitHub before pull request.
If some programmer made mistake and test found it,
it notify the programmer about mistake and save time.

For example, [HP company uses system](https://www.edureka.co/blog/companies-using-devops/#hp)
that checks if any of a unit test has been broken.
It helps to fix bugs and add new code more efficiently

### User feedback

Continuous monitoring of metrics, user feedback together with small product
life cycle increase integration with users to provide high quality product.

For metric monitoring it is possible to use Yandex.Cloud.
This service provide
monitoring and API for server metrics.
For example, [ETSY uses AWS](https://www.edureka.co/blog/companies-using-devops/#etsy)
for DevOps. AWS also provides server monitoring

For user feedback it is possible to use Google Forms,
reviews in stores (for mobile apps),
in GitHub (for open source products),
or directly from application.
