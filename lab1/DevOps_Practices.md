## Task 1: Research and Define DevOps Principles and Practices

DevOps is a methodology combining principles, approaches and tools that increase the speed of creating applications and services. It helps to automate processes, increase their efficiency and reduce the time to implement changes or solve technical problems.  
In my research on this issue I have identified several basic principles of this methodology.  
1. **Communication and Collaboration.** The development and operations teams must integrate and work as one common team from the beginning to the end of the project. There should be a culture of ownership and responsibility for the end result.  
2. **Automation.** It is necessary to automate the software development process as much as possible. This will reduce the human factor and increase the productivity of the team. 
3. **Continuous improvement.** According to this principle, the team should focus on reducing the loss of key resources.  
4. **Customer Orientation.** The team should use short feedback loops with customers in order to get feedback from the customer as quickly as possible and meet their needs as fully as possible.  

Following these principles created DevOps best practices.
1. **Continuous integration and delivery `(CI/CD)`.** These are two practices in which all code changes are regularly merged into a central repository, and any changes to the code are automatically built, tested, and prepared for final release.
2. **Micro Service Architecture `(MA)`.** This practice involves creating an application from a set of small services. Each service is tied to a business goal and data exchange between services is performed through API-based programming interface.
3. **Infrastructure as Code `(IaC)` and Configuration Management `(CM)`.** These are practices in which the infrastructure is managed through code and development methods. They allow developers and system administrators to interact with the infrastructure at the software level at any scale, instead of having to install and configure resources manually.
4. **Monitoring and logging.** The practice involves tracking metrics and logging events, which helps assess key metrics such as performance, security, availability, and others. Collecting, analyzing this data helps companies effectively monitor the stability of their products.
