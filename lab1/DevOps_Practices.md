##  Task 1: Core principles and practices of DevOps

There are different sources that describe principles and the best practices of DevOps.

### Amount of principles vary from 5 to 8. **Principles as follows**:
- **Collaboration**: The interaction of software engineers and system administrators has given rise to the term developer operations or DevOps. This is the core of the DevOps team. Collaboration also depends on good information-sharing practices

- **Customer Centric Action**(Decision Making): this principle is led by the question "Will this benefit the customer?". Moreover, DevOps teams use active monitoring strategy to overtake issues/bus/crashes

- **Constant Improvement**: the idea that the team should continuously focus on new features and upgrades or increment(Agile). 

- **Automation**: Automate everything you can. This gives developers more time to write code and develop new features. Automation is a key element of a CI/CD pipeline and helps to reduce human errors and increase team productivity.

- **Database Centric Action**(Decision Making): Use team's metrics and historical data to make your decision such as choosing tech stack and tools.

- **End To End Responsibility**(Throughout the Lifecycle): While traditional organizations develop solution then pass it to another team to demploy and maintan, DevOps teams take responsibility to create and deliver the product.

- **Create with the end mind**: Do not make assumtions about use cases. DevOps teams should have a holistic understanding of the product, from creation to implementation

- **Failure as a Learning Opportunity**: DevOps is an adaptable development approach where processes are continuously adjusted alongside ongoing software enhancements. To uphold this adaptability, failure is perceived as a chance to gain knowledge and enhance performance. Instead of striving to evade failure entirely, it is important to foster a culture of calculated risk-taking in appropriate situations


### Amount of practices vary from 8 to 16. **Practices as follows**:
