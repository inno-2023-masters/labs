## Task 1: Understanding Version Control Systems

#### Definition: 
Version control systems (VCS) are tools that manage changes to files, enabling collaboration. They track versions, facilitate teamwork, and provide a history of changes.
#### Benefits of VCS in collaboration:
- Change tracking: Detailed record of modifications.
- Concurrent work: Multiple developers can work simultaneously.
- Rollbacks: Revert to previous versions.
- Branching and merging: Create independent lines of development and merge changes.
- Collaboration: Share work, review code, and resolve conflicts.
#### Types of VCS:
- Centralized VCS (CVCS): Central server stores the project's history (Subversion, Perforce).
- Distributed VCS (DVCS): Each developer has a complete local copy (Git, Mercurial).
#### Comparison of popular VCS:
- Git: Distributed, fast, scalable, strong branching and merging.
- Subversion: Centralized, strong directory-level change tracking, easy to use. It offers strong support for tracking directory-level changes and is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
- Mercurial: Distributed, simple, intuitive command set.
