# Version Control Systems
## Definition and Purpose
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that enable management and tracking of changes to files and projects over time. They provide systematic way to track modifications and manage different versions of files or source code. Primary purpose of version control is to maintain reliable history of changes, collaboration among team members and enable easy reverting to previous versions.

## Benefits and Advantages
Using version control systems in a collaborative software development environment offers several benefits:

- **Change Tracking**: VCS keeps track of every modification made to files. Such detailed history allows developers to understand and review changes, identify issues and resolve conflicts.

- **Collaboration**: Version control enables seamless collaboration among team members by providing a central repository where everyone can contribute and merge changes. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently without overwriting each other's modifications.

- **Branching and Merging**: VCS supports branching, which allows developers to create separate lines of development. This feature is useful for experimenting with new features or fixing bugs without disrupting the main codebase. Merging allows the integration of different branches back into the main project once changes are complete and tested.

- **Rollback and Recovery**: If mistake is made or bug is introduced, version control makes it easy to roll back to a previous stable version. It provides a safety net, ensuring that previous versions of the code or files are always available for recovery.

- **Traceability and Accountability**: VCS maintain a complete audit trail, enabling developers to trace the evolution of the codebase or files. It also helps assign accountability by attributing specific changes to individual contributors.

## Types of Version Control Systems
There are primarily two types of version control systems:

- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**: In CVCS, central server acts as single point of truth and stores entire version history and files. Developers check out files from central repository, make changes locally and then check them back in. Examples of CVCS include Subversion (SVN) and Perforce.

- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**: In DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of repository, including full history and files. This decentralization allows developers to work offline and perform most version control operations locally. Git, Mercurial and Bazaar are popular examples of DVCS.

## Comparison of Popular Version Control Systems
**Git**

Git is a widely used distributed version control system known for its speed and powerful branching and merging capabilities. It has become standard in open source projects and has a vast community and ecosystem supporting it. Git offers a rich set of features, such as local branching, staging changes before commit and integration with popular hosting platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

**Subversion (SVN)**

Subversion, also known as SVN, is a centralized version control system designed to be a successor to CVS (Concurrent Versions System). It follows a client-server architecture, where central repository stores project's history. SVN focuses on stability, ease of use and smooth migration from CVS. However, it lacks some advanced features present in distributed version control systems.

**Mercurial**

Mercurial is another distributed version control system that emphasizes ease of use and performance. It offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface and is known for its efficiency in handling large projects. Mercurial provides robust support for branching and merging, making it popular among developers who prioritize simplicity and straightforwardness.
