# Version Control Systems

## Definition of version control systems and their purpose

Version controls systems are an easy way for groups of developers to work on the same project in parallel.

## Explanation of the benefits and advantages of using version control in a collaborative environment

Usage of version control systems improves collaboration and code merging. Moreover, with version control systems, it is easy to revert changes when needed. Finally, as mentioned above, version control systems allow developers to work on the same project in parallel.

## Overview of different types of version control systems

There are 3 types of version control systems: local, centralized, and distributed:

1. Local version control systems are the simplest ones. They are used on a single computer and are not suitable for collaboration.

2. Centralized version control systems are used by multiple developers. They have a single server that stores all the files and can be accessed by multiple developers. The main disadvantage of centralized version control systems is that it has a single point of failure - the server.

3. Distributed version control systems are similar to centralized version control systems, but they have multiple servers, so it allows collaboration, while also eliminating one server as a single point of failure.

## Comparison of popular version control systems

There are many version control systems, but the most popular ones are Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

1. Git is a distributed version control system. Nowadays it is the most popular version control system.

2. Mercurial is also a distributed version control system. It is very similar to Git, but it is less popular.

3. Subversion is a centralized version control system which is its biggest difference from Git and Mercurial.
