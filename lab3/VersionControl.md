## Definition of version control systems

```

Version control systems are tools that help in management changes to project files. These systems track different versions of file. Thus, users can revert changes or reset to some point of time.
```

## Version control systems purpose

```
The purpose of version control systems is to provide a structured and organized way to manage changes to files and documents.

## Explanation of the benefits and advantages of using version control in a collaborative environment

1. **History tracking:** It maintains a detailed history of changes made to files, making it easy to review and understand modifications.

2. **Collaboration:** Multiple users can work on the same files simultaneously without conflicts.

3. **Rollback and recovery:** If a mistake is made or unwanted changes occur, version control allows users to revert to previous versions easily, minimizing the impact of errors.

4. **Branching and merging:** it allows users to create separate versions of a project. Branches can be merged back together, enabling parallel development and experimentation without affecting the main project.

5. **Backup and synchronization:** Version control systems often include backup features. Therefore It ensures that project files are securely stored and synchronized across multiple devices.

## Overview of different types of version control systems (centralized, distributed, etc.)

- Centralized version control: These systems have a central server that stores the entire project's history and files. Users check out files from the server to make modifications, and changes are committed back to the server. 

- Distributed version control systems: These systems' users maintains a complete copy of the project's history and files on their local machine. Moreover Users can make changes and commit them locally, and later push those changes to a central server or share them directly with others. 


## Comparison of popular version control systems (Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc.)

1. **Git**: Git is a distributed version control system known for its speed and scalability. It has become the most widely used version control system due to its powerful branching and merging capabilities, excellent support for collaboration, and vast community support.

2. **Subversion**: Subversion is a centralized version control system that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It offers many of the same core features as Git but lacks some of its advanced functionalities, such as distributed nature and efficient branching.

3. **Mercurial**: Mercurial is another distributed version control system, similar to Git in many aspects. It emphasizes ease of use and has a more intuitive command structure compared to Git. It also provides robust support for collaboration and branching.
